    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 - Introduction to Data and Machine Learning on the GCP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first course of the data engineer track, you will gain an overview of the data and machine learning\n",
    "parts of Google Cloud platform. And not just in cursory overview. So what we're going to be\n",
    "doing is that in each module, everything is going to be two pronged.\n",
    "\n",
    "At one level, we will look at some products that help you accomplish certain things on Google Cloud. But at the same time, we'll look at very specific use cases, very common use cases that\n",
    "involve machine learning, that involve data processing, that involve data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you look at how to accomplish those use cases using this particular products. And we'll do this over and over again. And by the time we're done with this course you will have basically gotten a pretty good overview of all\n",
    "of the moving parts of the data and ML parts of the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 - About Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course I'll be providing\n",
    "a very quick overview of GCP, in particular its foundational\n",
    "parts to compute and storage. And then we dive straight in to\n",
    "provide a deeper overview of the different ways you can\n",
    "process data with GCP. So we'll talk about BigQuery, Dataflow,\n",
    "Dataproc, Cloud SQL, Datalab, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So who's this class meant for? It's for meant for\n",
    "what we call data engineers. People who design, build,\n",
    "maintain data structures, databases, data processing systems,\n",
    "data pipelinesand who do extraction,\n",
    "transformation, loading of data, move data from one place to another. These may be data scientists\n",
    "who are analyzing data, enabling machine learning to happen, maybe\n",
    "even doing machine learning yourself. People who model business processes, who enable data driven decision\n",
    "making within your company. So if you recognize yourself in any of\n",
    "these things this class is meant for you. It's meant for anyone who'll be working\n",
    "with data on Google Cloud Platform. It's also meant for any decision\n",
    "makers who are trying to decide whether your company should move to GCP\n",
    "and do your data processing on GCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course gives you a good overview of all\n",
    "the capabilities that the Google Cloud provides so\n",
    "that you can make an informed decision. We will now\n",
    "start with an overview of Google Cloud Platform as a whole,\n",
    "but with particular emphasis on the ways you can\n",
    "handle data in the platform. The way you can ingest data, different\n",
    "ways of doing processing of data, whether with map produce,\n",
    "such as with Spark or whether with a streaming\n",
    "mechanism like with Dataflow. We look at BigQuery, which is our\n",
    "auto scaling date warehouse, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll give you overview of GCP, but with an emphasis on the data\n",
    "handling parts of it. We'll also then move on to talking\n",
    "about the foundation of GCP and this is computing and storage. Like any computer, and\n",
    "the Cloud is a computer, the two key parts of a computer are the computing units and\n",
    "the storage units of persistent data. And the way that happens on the Cloud is\n",
    "with Compute Engine and Cloud Storage, so we'll talk about both of those. And then we'll move on to things\n",
    "that you're probably doing today, that you could easily move to the Cloud. We'll talk about the use cases that are\n",
    "quite common that Google provides a good managed environment for such that you\n",
    "can take things you're doing on premise, on your own hardware, and\n",
    "move it to the Cloud quite easily. Because the same software that you may\n",
    "be using Is also present on the Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "As examples of those use cases,we will talk about relational databases in the form of Cloud SQL,\n",
    "which is a MySQL database hosted on GCP. And we'll talk about Cloud Dataproc,\n",
    "which is a hosted version of big Spark hype of the Hadoop\n",
    "ecosystem software processes. So in order to do that we'll\n",
    "look at how to import data and how to query MySQL\n",
    "running in Google Cloud. And similarly, we'll also look at how\n",
    "to take a Spark program, submit it, and have it run on Cloud Dataproc. And the Spark program that we will look\n",
    "at will be a machine-learning program to carry out recommendations. And once we have talked about\n",
    "the use cases that we're talking about, migrating use cases,\n",
    "we will then move on talking about more\n",
    "transformational use cases. These may be things that\n",
    "you may not be doing today, mainly because it may not be possible for\n",
    "you to do them today.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we look at how you could query petabytes of data in a matter\n",
    "of seconds with Google BigQuery. We will talk about how to\n",
    "do fast random access, trading off global consistency\n",
    "versus low global availability. We'll also talk about machine learning. We'll talk about how to do TensorFlow. Maybe you run TensorFlow, but very commonly maybe running\n",
    "it on a single machine. We'll talk about how you'd run\n",
    "TensorFlow in a distributed fashion on the Cloud over\n",
    "extremely large data sets. And then we will move onto\n",
    "just providing a very quick overview of how you would do\n",
    "scalable reliable data processing on Google Cloud with Cloud Pub/Sub,\n",
    "which is a messaging architecture and with Cloud Dataflow,\n",
    "which is a way to execute code that processes both streaming data and\n",
    "batch data in essentially the same way. And finally, we'll come to\n",
    "the conclusion of the course, and I'll leave you with some resources for\n",

    "## 1.2.2 Introduction to GPC and Big Data Products\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the Google Cloud platform? Well, let's start out by talking\n",
    "about what cloud computing is. When I started out in computing\n",
    "a couple decades ago, everything that we did was on-premise. So I had a work station, and this work\n",
    "station was literally under my desk. And if I needed to run a program,\n",
    "I would run it on that machine. If something happened to the machine, I would yank out the power cord,\n",
    "I would plug it back in. I owned the machine, I managed the\n",
    "software on it, I installed everything. I had root access on that machine. It was all mine. I managed the software data, Christie did the networking, I paid for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's essentially \"on premise\" computing. But at some point, things changed and it became well you don't have to. Let's go ahead and take all of our machines, put them in this nice data center. So we had a new building,\n",
    "we had data center and we basically had all of our\n",
    "machines in that data center, we still owned the data center, because it\n",
    "was just another floor of our building and whenever we would have visitors\n",
    "to our lab we would take them and very proudly show them this is where\n",
    "all of our computing happens, right? So we had our data center, we owned\n",
    "the hardware, but the electricity, the networking,\n",
    "the physical security of that place, that not everybody could\n",
    "walk into that data center. All that was managed by the people\n",
    "who managed the data center.\n",
    "\n",
    "But my group still paid for the hardware. We essentially paid a portion of the data\n",
    "center costs, in terms of a portion of the \"rent\" if you will. But we essentially still\n",
    "own those machines. We control those machine. We install the software on them. We decided when those\n",
    "machines would get upgraded. But we had kind of given up was direct\n",
    "physical access to those machines. Now if you think about it, this evolution\n",
    "from things being completely under my desk to being slightly out of reach but\n",
    "something that I'm still controlling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud computing is the next step of that. And with cloud computing\n",
    "the big cloud vendors, whether it's Google or Amazon or\n",
    "Microsoft, they own the hardware, they manage the electricity,\n",
    "they manage the networking, they manage the physical\n",
    "security into those data centers. But, you don't even own the hardware. So what you end up doing is that you\n",
    "ask for some computing resource. And as we see later, the computing\n",
    "resource could be a virtual machine, but in many cases,\n",
    "you prefer it not to be virtual machines. You don't want to work\n",
    "at such a low level, where you're spinning up VMs and spinning\n",
    "them down. You want to think in terms of higher level constructs like here\n",
    "is a job that I want to run. Or here's a SQL query that\n",
    "I want to execute, right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you have some kind of computing that you need to do. And when you need to that, you ask for\n",
    "resources to carry that computing out and you pay only only for\n",
    "those resources that you use. And the whole cloud is \n",
    "a shared resource and you get those resources for the time that\n",
    "you need and you give them them back, and you're not worried anymore\n",
    "about not using it or  over-provisioning servers that you're not using or not having enough of a computing\n",
    "resource when you need it, because somebody else is using it, etc. Right, so the whole idea behind cloud\n",
    "computing is that you have an available resource whenever you need, and\n",
    "you're not paying for it when you don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is Google in the cloud business? This is our mission. It's to organize the world's information,\n",
    "make it universally accessible and useful. What does that have to do with cloud? Doesn't seem that cloud computing and organizing the world's information have anything in common. So why is Google in the business of cloud? Well, it turns out that if you need to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\n",
    "there are some things that you have to do. One of the things that you have to do if\n",
    "you are going to organize the world's information, because there is a lot\n",
    "of it and it's keeps on growing, is that you have to build\n",
    "extremely powerful infrastructure. There is a statistic that blew my\n",
    "mind the first time I heard about it. Of every five CPUs that\n",
    "are produced in the world today, year on year, Google buys one of them. Think about that for a second. Google buys one in every five CPUs that's produced year on year. That goes into our infrastructure. So you can imagine how powerful that infrastructure is that we have to build in order to organize\n",
    "the world's information.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's the physical hardware, right? In addition,\n",
    "we have to make it universally accessible. And if you want to make information\n",
    "universally accessible, you have to build global data centers,\n",
    "you have to build a global network so we have private fibers\n",
    "between all the continents, and you need to have edge locations\n",
    "in a lot of different countries. An edge location is essentially this\n",
    "idea that if somebody's accessing your resource, say from Africa for example, the\n",
    "second person who's trying to access that resource shouldn't have to go across\n",
    "the world to go get the resource again. They should be able to get a cached\n",
    "version of that resource from an edge location. So you need to maintain edge locations, and edge locations are in a lotmore places than the data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But within the data center also, the design of the data centers is such that any two machines\n",
    "in the data center are just a hop away. That you can basically have some. If you look at the East West\n",
    "cross-section versus, so if you look at the network bisectional bandwidth between machine and google data center it's\n",
    "more than petabit a second. So now you're looking at\n",
    "an extremely fast networking and extremely global infrastructure that\n",
    "needed to get built in order to make that information that we had collected and\n",
    "organized universally accessible. That's the physical part of it. In addition,\n",
    "we've tended to run into problems of large amount of data\n",
    "ahead of most other people, most other companies in the world. So what that has ended up doing is\n",
    "that we have ended up innovating in data technologies, pioneering many of the alternative techniques\n",
    "that you're all familiar with now.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, GFS, the Google File System, and Map Produce, those were two papers that\n",
    "came out of Google research. And they from the basis of what? Yup. HDFS, the Hadoop Distributed File System\n",
    "is based on the Google files system GFS. And Hadoop itself, the MapReduce\n",
    "frame work is based on the paper by Sanjay Ghemawat and Jeff Dean on\n",
    "MapReduce that's published in 2004. And, of course, HDFS and HADOOP\n",
    "basically led to the whole ecosystem of a bright and open source at DOOP Tools\n",
    "that are available in the world today. Something to kind of realize is that\n",
    "even though we published this paper in 2004 in MapReduce, by about 2006 we were\n",
    "no longer creating new MapReduce programs. We had moved on. Why had we moved on? Well, some people realized\n",
    "that the whole MapReduce framework the way it works, is that if you\n",
    "have a very, very, very large dataset, you take that dataset and\n",
    "you chop it up into small pieces and you store those pieces on\n",
    "different compute notes. Close to the compute, and then you\n",
    "basically have each of the compute nodes doing their little bit of\n",
    "processing on their local data. Those are the map operations. And then take those results. You combine them and\n",
    "then you basically do processing on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the key point is that you have to take your data set, and you have to shard it, or split it,\n",
    "across all of the computer notes, which means you are all\n",
    "decisive of your data sets and decisive of your computer notes\n",
    "are intimately tied together, and that kind of limits your scheme,\n",
    "because you are often wasting a whole bunch of computer nodes just\n",
    "because you need to store your data there. Or if you need to process some\n",
    "data you can only process it on the compute notes that\n",
    "already have that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this changed. And so this is part of the innovation and data technology that came about such\n",
    "that GFS, the Google file system, got replaced by Colossus,\n",
    "which is the current file system. Of course, there have been enhancements\n",
    "in Colossus all along the way. MapReduce got, not changed. So, we don't do MapReduce\n",
    "at Google anymore. Instead, the data processing\n",
    "technologies  of choice are Dremel and Flume, and those are both externalized\n",
    "in Google Cloud as BigQuery and Dataflow, that we will look at. So the point is that with all of the innovation that's happening at Google to build our own infrastructure, with Google cloud we're opening up that\n",
    "innovation such that you can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Dremel, which I talked about, is the basis of Big Query. Flume, the thing that started in 2010,\n",
    "it started in 2010, but it has continually gotten enhanced. So Flume and Millwheel, etc., they all form what is now\n",
    "externalized as data flow. And tensof flow 2015\n",
    "forms a basis of cloud ML. CLoud ML is a whole state and\n",
    "in flow solution. Similarly you have PupSub which\n",
    "has been released as itself. And spoonerism now in alpha etc. So you basically have all\n",
    "these innovations that continually get released\n",
    "into Google Cloud. So, one of the things is that if\n",
    "you're working on Google Cloud, you basically have access to all of\n",
    "Google's data processing capabilities. Now, I talked about how the Mapreduce\n",
    "that we used to use in 2004, we don't use anymore. And, I kind of mentioned that one of the\n",
    "reasons that we don't use it is because MapReduce tends to be limited by the\n",
    "number of compute nodes that you have, and that we have better solutions\n",
    "now in the form of big query and in the form of data flow. And that illustrates a key point. If you're doing cloud computing today, many times though what you may think of as cloud is essentially the change from core\n",
    "location to a vitalized data center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the slide that I showed early\n",
    "on that said what is cloud computing? And I said cloud computing is\n",
    "evolution of you going from things that are being on premise\n",
    "to being on a data center, where you know you basically\n",
    "still own the hardware, but part of the management of that hardware has\n",
    "gone away and that with cloud computing you don't have to own the hardware\n",
    "you don't have to manage any of it. You just get to get\n",
    "the resources that you need. Right, that is the idea. But if you are working in the cloud\n",
    "at the level of virtual machines, if you're saying, I'm going to spin\n",
    "up a VM so I can run this job and I'm going to reserve this VM for months\n",
    "on end so I can keep running this job, at that point, you've lost much\n",
    "of the benefits of the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud is hugely beneficial if you are running things ephemerally, if you're\n",
    "running things just when you need them. So that's kind of what we're\n",
    "talking about when we talk about how a virtualized data center\n",
    "is your second wave of cloud. It's not yet\n",
    "getting the full benefit of the cloud. The true benefit of the cloud\n",
    "happens when you're using the cloud in an elastic\n",
    "completely global way. And what I mean by that is that you should\n",
    "be able to auto-scale your clusters, you should be able to\n",
    "do distributed storage, distributed data processing,\n",
    "distributed machine learning. If you have a job, and that job\n",
    "can be done on a thousand machines in seconds, you should be able to\n",
    "do it on a thousand machines for ten seconds and just pay for that. You shouldn't have to go ahead and\n",
    "create a cluster of 10 machines, and then process that job\n",
    "on those ten machines for 10 hours or twelve hours or\n",
    "whatever it takes you. The whole idea behind an elastic\n",
    "cloud is this idea that you get to use your machines just for\n",
    "the time that you need them, and then when you don't need them,\n",
    "it's not on your bill anymore."

    "## 1.2.3 - GPC Big Data Products\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's move on to talk about\n",
    "the big data products in GCP. So the best way to think about\n",
    "the Google Cloud Platform is that it's a set of building blocks. It is a set of things that are well\n",
    "designed such that they are well designed, that they are well integrated, such that\n",
    "you can put together your own solutions to solve your problems in a very\n",
    "convenient and very intuitive way. So Spotify kind of illustrates\n",
    "the typical customer journey. So these are all Spotify tweets. And Spotify came to Google Cloud, the\n",
    "reason that most people come to the cloud. It's not to spend less,\n",
    "but to just pay for the use to basically get more security, now because things can be\n",
    "safer if they're secured on the cloud with Google's security\n",
    "engineering team, for example. It can be no-ops, no-ops is, again,\n",
    "a word that we'll use quite a bit. And what we mean by\n",
    "no-ops in this context, a no-op is essentially no\n",
    "systems operation required. In other words, you don't need to\n",
    "spin up a cluster and do a job on it. You just have a job, and\n",
    "you submit it to the cloud. And Google cloud figures out which\n",
    "machines to run it on, runs it, and you don't even interact with those\n",
    "machines at all, for example. So those are all advantages. So that's the reason why many\n",
    "companies come to the cloud. And that's kind of why\n",
    "Spotify came to the cloud. So this was one of their tweets, did you hear we're migrating from our own\n",
    "data centers to Google Cloud Platform? And then they realized, hey, look, I see\n",
    "two nice building blocks in Google cloud. I see something called Pub/Sub\n",
    "with some messaging system. And I see data flow with a data\n",
    "pipeline execution environment. And look, if I can put these two things together, we\n",
    "can build our own event delivery system. So that's our second tweet. See how we use Google cloud, Pub/Sub, and data flow to build our own\n",
    "event delivery system. In other words, there is this whole flexibility to\n",
    "put together your own solutions. That's great, but in addition\n",
    "to building your own solutions, there is also the extreme power\n",
    "that already comes built in. And that was that third tweet where\n",
    "there's a Google's bit query is the bomb. You can start with 2.2 billion things and summarize down to 20,000\n",
    "things in less than a minute. And the reason that he's so\n",
    "excited is that before bit query, it probably took them, I don't know,\n",
    "maybe an hour, maybe a couple of hours. So there's a huge benefit in\n",
    "terms of business advantage, to take things that used to take\n",
    "you hours and do them in seconds. And that's kind of where that's a promise, that transformational aspect\n",
    "of doing things on the cloud. You may never be able to convince\n",
    "your boss to give you 3,000 machines if you're not going to use\n",
    "those 3,000 machines all the time. But on the cloud, you can get\n",
    "3,000 machines for a few minutes, get your job done. And that time savings is worth a lot. Another way to look at the Google cloud\n",
    "is functionally, what does it do? What do these products do? So each of these blue hexagons is\n",
    "a Google cloud platform product. And they all do different things. So you can group them. For example, there is the foundational\n",
    "pieces, there is the computing, there is storage, Compute Engine and\n",
    "Cloud Storage, which are a foundation. You have a number of types of databases, Cloud Datastore, Cloud SQL, Bigtable, etc. These all have different target use cases,\n",
    "and we'll talk about them, why you might want to use Datastore\n",
    "versus Cloud SQL versus Bigtable. But these are all databases. And then you have some things that\n",
    "are about analytics, like BigQuery, or about machine learning, like Cloud ML, or\n",
    "the Translate API, or the Vision API, etc. And then you have data-handling\n",
    "frameworks, things that help you deal with streaming data, that help\n",
    "you move data from one place to another. This is things like Pub/Sub,\n",
    "Dataflow, Dataproc, etc. So this is the way that we are going to\n",
    "look at the cloud platform, we look at them in terms of these things. We look at foundational stuff, we look at\n",
    "databases, we look at analytics and ML. And then we look at\n",
    "data-handling frameworks. The reason that there are all of\n",
    "these big hexagons is that Google is trying to solve a particular issue\n",
    "related to how people get onto the cloud. Which is that a lot of times, people want to migrate the code\n",
    "that they're already running. So it's just about changing\n",
    "where they're computing, not actually changing the code itself. Because you don't want to do too\n",
    "many things at the same time. So you may take software services\n",
    "that you're running on-premise, and you may might want to\n",
    "move it to Google cloud. And so in that sense, what all that you\n",
    "want to do is to change where you compute, but you want to do\n",
    "exactly the same things. So if today, in your own data center,\n",
    "you're running a Hadoop cluster and you want to move that code, that project,\n",
    "over to the cloud platform, well, you can take Cloud Dataproc and\n",
    "migrate things over. You can migrate your Hadoop, Spark, or big jobs over to Google cloud,\n",
    "and run it on Cloud Dataproc. Similarly, if you have a MySQL database, you could run it on\n",
    "Google Cloud using Cloud SQL. So these are all different ways of taking\n",
    "things that you're already doing and just changing where you're\n",
    "doing the computation. At another level, the reason that\n",
    "you maybe move in to the cloud is because the cloud gives you greater\n",
    "scalability and reliability. So if you need to do very large scale,\n",
    "very reliable messaging, you might want to use Cloud Pub/Sub. If you want to do very scalable,\n",
    "very flexible, very reliable data processing,\n",
    "you may want to do Dataflow. But you might also do it in Spark with\n",
    "Dataproc and take advantage of the fact that with Dataproc, you'll get to\n",
    "resize clusters very quickly, right? So you may be looking at using\n",
    "the DataFlow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub for the scalability and\n",

    "## 1.2.4 Big Data Products\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's move on to talk about\n",
    "the big data products in GCP. So the best way to think about\n",
    "the Google Cloud Platform is that it's a set of building blocks. It is a set of things that are well\n",
    "designed such that they are well designed, they are well integrated, such that\n",
    "you can put together your own solutions to solve your problems in a very\n",
    "convenient and very intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Spotify kind of illustrates the typical customer journey. Spotify came to Google Cloud, the\n",
    "reason that most people come to the cloud. It's not to spend less,\n",
    "but to just pay for the use to basically get more security, now because things can be\n",
    "safer if they're secured on the cloud with Google's security\n",
    "engineering team, for example. It can be no-ops. No-ops is, again,\n",
    "a word that we'll use quite a bit. And what we mean by\n",
    "no-ops in this context, a no-op is essentially no\n",
    "systems operation required. In other words, you don't need to\n",
    "spin up a cluster and do a job on it. You just have a job, and\n",
    "you submit it to the cloud. And Google cloud figures out which\n",
    "machines to run it on, runs it, and you don't even interact with those\n",
    "machines at all, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So those are all advantages. So that's the reason why many\n",
    "companies come to the cloud. And that's kind of why\n",
    "Spotify came to the cloud. They realized, hey, look, I see\n",
    "two nice building blocks in Google cloud. I see something called Pub/Sub\n",
    "with some messaging system. And I see data flow with a data\n",
    "pipeline execution environment. And look, if I can put these two things together, we\n",
    "can build our own event delivery system. See how they use Google cloud, Pub/Sub, and data flow to build our own\n",
    "event delivery system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there is this whole flexibility to\n",
    "put together your own solutions. That's great, but in addition\n",
    "to building your own solutions, there is also the extreme power\n",
    "that already comes built in. And that was that third tweet where\n",
    "there's a \"Google's BigQuery is the bomb. You can start with 2.2 billion things and summarize down to 20,000\n",
    "things in less than a minute.\" And the reason that he's so\n",
    "excited is that before BigQuery, it probably took them, I don't know,\n",
    "maybe an hour, maybe a couple of hours. So there's a huge benefit in\n",
    "terms of business advantage, to take things that used to take\n",
    "you hours and do them in seconds. And that's kind of where that's a promise, that transformational aspect\n",
    "of doing things on the cloud. You may never be able to convince\n",
    "your boss to give you 3,000 machines if you're not going to use\n",
    "those 3,000 machines all the time. But on the cloud, you can get\n",
    "3,000 machines for a few minutes, get your job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that time savings is worth a lot. Another way to look at the Google cloud\n",
    "is functionally, what does it do? What do these products do? So each of these blue hexagons is\n",
    "a Google cloud platform product. And they all do different things. So you can group them.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Category                  |Technology                                           |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data-handling frameworks ate things that help you deal with streaming data, that help\n",
    "you move data from one place to another. These are things like Pub/Sub,\n",
    "Dataflow, Dataproc, etc. So this is the way that we are going to\n",
    "look at the cloud platform, we look at them in terms of these things. We look at foundational stuff, we look at\n",
    "databases, we look at analytics and ML. And then we look at\n",
    "data-handling frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that there are all of\n",
    "these big hexagons is that Google is trying to solve a particular issue\n",
    "related to how people get onto the cloud. Which is that a lot of times, people want to migrate the code\n",
    "that they're already running. So it's just about changing\n",
    "where they're computing, not actually changing the code itself. Because you don't want to do too\n",
    "many things at the same time. So you may take software services\n",
    "that you're running on-premise, and you may might want to\n",
    "move it to Google cloud. And so in that sense, all that you\n",
    "want to do is to change where you compute, but you want to do\n",
    "exactly the same things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So if today, in your own data center,\n",
    "you're running a Hadoop cluster and you want to move that code, that project,\n",
    "over to the cloud platform, well, you can take Cloud Dataproc and\n",
    "migrate things over. You can migrate your Hadoop, Spark, or big jobs over to Google cloud,\n",
    "and run it on Cloud Dataproc. Similarly, if you have a MySQL database, you could run it on\n",
    "Google Cloud using Cloud SQL. So these are all different ways of taking\n",
    "things that you're already doing and just changing where you're\n",
    "doing the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At another level, the reason that\n",
    "you maybe move in to the cloud is because the cloud gives you greater\n",
    "scalability and reliability. So if you need to do very large scale,\n",
    "very reliable messaging, you might want to use Cloud Pub/Sub. If you want to do very scalable,\n",
    "very flexible, very reliable data processing,\n",
    "you may want to do Dataflow. But you might also do it in Spark with\n",
    "Dataproc and take advantage of the fact that with Dataproc, you'll get to\n",
    "resize clusters very quickly, right? So you may be looking at using\n",
    "the DataFlow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub for the scalability and\n",
    "reliability that the cloud provides. This is the concept that I was talking\n",
    "about where if you are running things on a cluster of, say, not 20 machines or\n",
    "30 machines, then the reason you're doing it is because you have to\n",
    "justify the cost on an annual basis. You may be able to go ahead and do that\n",

    "# 1.3 Foundations of GCP Compute and Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.1 Introduction to GCP Compute and Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start talking about\n",
    "the Foundations of GCP. And the foundations of GCP lies with its\n",
    "computing and storage infrastructure. Any computer consists of computing, and storage, and networking to\n",
    "connect the computing in storage. The Cloud computer, is also a computer. It's a global computer, but\n",
    "it also contains a compute engine. It contains storage and networking that\n",
    "you don't directly interact with, but networking that's there in any case, for you to connect the computing that you are\n",
    "doing with your data that you have stored. So in this module we look at\n",
    "the foundations of Google Cloud Platform, the compute engine and cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.2. CPU's on Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any computer, and\n",
    "the cloud computer is a computer, you need compute processing units, CPUs. And the CPUs on the cloud are provided\n",
    "by a compute engine of virtual machines. And you need a place to store your input\n",
    "data, to store your output data, to store your intermediate data, things that\n",
    "are persistent, things that are temporary. And that storage on GCP is\n",
    "provided by cloud storage. And connecting the two,\n",
    "connecting the virtual machines or compute engine instances\n",
    "with these storage units or cloud storage is a private network. You think not to directly interact\n",
    "with this network but it's there and it is what allows you to have a global\n",
    "scale data and compute infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "GCP provides:\n",
    "* Computer Engine\n",
    "* Global Private Network\n",
    "* Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals: To be as no-ops as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides load-balancing, advanced networking, monitoring, clustering, container support. You also get after-the-fact discounts for un-used capacity. Pre-emptible machines allow you do use time on powerful machines but give it up if you are not using it. You can't depend on them, but they can give you greate boots in compute power.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part,\n",
    "when you work with GCP, you will not be working at the level at which we're\n",
    "going to be talking about in this chapter. So we're not going to be working at\n",
    "the level of individual virtual machines. No, you're not going to be spinning\n",
    "up VMs in order to do a job, we'll be working with things that\n",
    "are much higher level than that. But even if you need to\n",
    "work at this low level, in terms of infrastructure,\n",
    "the design goals of GCP remain the same. And the design goal is for working with cloud infrastructure\n",
    "to be as no-ops as possible. And no-ops here essentially means that we want to minimize a system\n",
    "administration overhead. And because we're talking\n",
    "about computing and storage, we want to basically also mention that we\n",
    "want this to be as flexible as possible. In such a way that you can\n",
    "change the type of virtual machine that you're running without\n",
    "paying any penalties, for example. So you're not reserving instances for\n",
    "long periods of time. In fact, we want to make\n",
    "it as flexible and easy for you to get your compute\n",
    "jobs done as possible. So when we talk about compute engine,\n",
    "the idea is in terms of flexibility. You can go ahead and get a compute\n",
    "engine that is say, N1 standard four and that's a very specific configuration\n",
    "of machines that you can have. But we would like you to stop thinking\n",
    "about it in terms of this very specific physical infrastructure, and instead start thinking in terms\n",
    "of more abstract concepts. So for example you might say, I want a virtual machine that\n",
    "has 8 CPUs and 30 gig of RAM. And it's the job of the Google cloud\n",
    "infrastructure to go ahead and fetch you a virtual machine that\n",
    "has 8 CPUs and 30 gigs of RAM. Regardless of the type of machine that you\n",
    "get, you will always get load balancing, advanced networking, monitoring,\n",
    "clustering, container support, etc. So there is no second class machine here. Every machine that you have,\n",
    "has all of these capabilities built in. At the same time we want to\n",
    "give you flexible compute. And you lose flexibility whenever\n",
    "you say that I have to go ahead and get a machine, and\n",
    "have to keep it running for months on end. Because face it,\n",
    "if you're running a machine for months on end,\n",
    "you have essentially bought the machine. And what we want is for you to work\n",
    "with machines on the order of minutes. However, there are always going to be\n",
    "workloads where you might find yourself having a machine and using it fully\n",
    "tilt for long periods of time. Rather than ask you to try to determine\n",
    "which of your workloads you are going to be running for long periods of time,\n",
    "GCP gives you a discount after the fact. So at the end of the month, if it turns\n",
    "out that you've used a machine for 60% of the month,\n",
    "you will automatically get a 15% discount. And this is something that happens\n",
    "on your bill after we've found that you've used it. So what this means is that you\n",
    "always get to retain your agility. So, for example, if you have a workload\n",
    "that's currently running on 8 CPUs and you decide that you need to\n",
    "increase it to 12 CPUs, for a few hours, well,\n",
    "go ahead and do that, right? You can move your workload to\n",
    "a different machine when you need to and move it back to a smaller machine\n",
    "when the peak loads go away. In addition to this whole idea of being\n",
    "able to change the machine type of stopped instances, you have another concept\n",
    "that's very, very, very useful, especially when it comes\n",
    "to jobs like Hadoop jobs. And this is the idea for\n",
    "preemptible virtual machine. The reason that GCP,\n",
    "one of the reasons that GCP can say, well, if you want an 8 CPU machine,\n",
    "30 gig of RAM, we'll find it for you and we'll give to you,\n",
    "is because some of those machines that are currently being used\n",
    "are what are called preemptible. Whoever is using those machines\n",
    "has agreed that in return for a hefty 80% discount on the machine\n",
    "charge, they agree to give it up if someone comes along and is willing\n",
    "to pay full price for those machines. So that's what a preemptible machine is. So a preemptible machine is a machine\n",
    "that you get a great discount on in return for your flexibility, in letting\n",
    "go of of it when you don't need it. But why would you do that? Why would have a machine that\n",
    "you're willing to give up? Well, if you're running a workload\n",
    "like Hadoop, which is fault-tolerant, if a machine goes away, well,\n",
    "whatever that machine was doing, those jobs get basically distributed\n",
    "among the other workers. Then preemptible machines are a great\n",
    "strategy to reduce your overall cost. So you might say, for example,\n",
    "that you're creating a data proc cluster, a data proc is a Hadoop cluster on GCP,\n",
    "but we look at it in the next chapter. So you may say I'm going to create a data\n",
    "proc cluster, and in my data proc cluster, I'm going to have 10 standard VMs and\n",
    "30 preemptible VMs. So now your job is going to\n",
    "get done four times faster. And at the same time,\n",
    "those extra 30 machines that you're using, are actually at 80% of the normal cost. So not only are you\n",
    "getting it done faster, you're also getting it done cheaper. So preemptible machines are good thing\n",
    "to incorporate into your strategy. With the idea that even if you\n",
    "don't get a preemptible machines, those standard machines are enough for you\n",
    "to get the job done in a timely manner. So you don't want to bank on a preemptible\n",
    "machine, being available when you need it, but if it is available and\n",
    "you happen to get it, you automatically gotten a huge discount on\n",
    "the total cost of your job."

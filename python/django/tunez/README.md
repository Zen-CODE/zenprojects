# Tunez Webserver

This project contains a Python Django-based webserver that serves a react
application for controlling the currently playing MPRIS2 compatible media
player.

## Installation instructions

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements

## Launch instructions

    sh run.sh

*Notes*: The application does require an MPRIS2 compatible media player running.
We recommend audacious.

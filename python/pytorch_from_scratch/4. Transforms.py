Transforms

Data does not always come in its final processed form that is required for
training machine learning algorithms. We use transforms to perform some 
manipulation of the data and make it suitable for training.

All TorchVision datasets have two parameters -transform to modify the
features and target_transform to modify the labels - that accept callables
 containing the transformation logic. The torchvision.transforms module 
 offers several commonly-used transforms out of the box.

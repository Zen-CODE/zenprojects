    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a mathematician by training, developing educational maths software unified two of Richard's core passions: mathematics and computer science. After joining CAMI Education in 1996, he initiated the company's transition from DOS (QuickBasic) to Windows (VisualBasic), developing Maths, Reading, Perceptual Skills, Reporting and Administration software programs for home and school usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building a suite of Windows-based Visual Basic 6 applications, he faced the task on internationalizing these applications to support Mandarin, Finnish, Gujarati and Arabic languages amongst others. This required building and deploying a fully unicode capable GUI for Visual Basic in order to overcome the limitations of VB’s native controls. In order to accomplish this, he made use of the vbRichClient and Cairo graphics libraries for rendering, simultaneously improving cosmetics via support for fully anti-aliased, alpha channel graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The announcement of Visual Basic’s end-of-life prompted his exploration of Python, cross platform toolkits and web-based frameworks. After experimenting with Django and Web2py, the discovery of Kivy, a Python-based cross-platform, native GUI toolkit, led to his renewed interest in modern, multi-touch applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Kivy framework, he now builds and distributes Windows, Android, iOS and Linux applications using a single, Python code base. After making various code contributions back to the Kivy project, he was invited to join the organization as a core developer in 2012, an offer happily accepted. Since then, he has made hundreds of commits to the project, and helps out extensively on the Kivy User group forum, providing help and assistance to other users. He is also part of the Kivy Organizaton, a team of international developers who make the core technical choices and decisions regarding the future of the Kivy project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his spare time, Richard enjoys playing with his son, building origami, dancing, playing guitar and riding his bicycle."

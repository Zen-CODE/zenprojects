Primary Colors (Traditional Subtractive):**\\n\\n*   **Red, Yellow, Blue:** These are the colors traditionally considered the primary colors in art and pigment mixing. All other colors can be created by mixing these. So, by this definition, there are **3** simple colors.\\n\\n**2. Primary Colors (Additive):**\\n\\n*   **Red, Green, Blue:** These are the primary colors of light (used in screens like TVs and computer monitors). Mixing these in different proportions creates a wide range of colors. So, by this definition, there are **3** simple colors.\\n\\n**3. Psychological Primaries (Unique Hues):**\\n\\n*   **Red, Green, Blue, Yellow:** Some color theories propose that these are the fundamental colors that humans perceive as \"pure\" or \"unique.\" We can\\'t describe red *as* a mix of other colors, for example (unlike orange, which we describe as a mix of red and yellow). This theory suggests **4** simple colors.\\n\\n**4. Basic Color Terms (Linguistic Approach):**\\n\\n*   This is the most complex. Linguists and anthropologists have studied how different cultures name colors. The number of basic color terms varies, but many languages have terms for:\\n    *   **Black, White, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue**\\n        *   If a language has only 2 color terms, it\\'s usually black and white (or dark and light).\\n        *   If it has 3, it\\'s often black, white, and red.\\n        *   Then green or yellow are added, followed by blue.\\n    *   Some languages also have basic terms for brown, orange, purple, pink, and gray.\\n    *   So, depending on the level, you could argue for anywhere from **2 to 11** \"simple\" colors based on language.\\n\\n**In summary:**\\n\\n*   There is no single universally agreed-upon number of \"simple\" colors.\\n*   The answer depends on the context: art, science, language, or psychology.\\n*   The most common answers are **3** (primary colors in art or light) or **4** (psychological primaries).\\n*   If we considered the most basic color terms in many languages, we could even say **6** .\\n\\nSo, to give the *best* answer, it really depends on how you define \"simple\". If I had to pick a single answer that\\'s often understood, I\\'d say **3 (Red, Yellow, Blue)** or **3 (Red, Green, Blue)** depending on context.\\n')], role='model'), citation_metadata=None, finish_message=None, token_count=None, avg_logprobs=-0.4494680287886639, finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'>, grounding_metadata=None, index=None, logprobs_result=None, safety_ratings=None)] create_time=None response_id=None model_version='gemini-2.0-flash' prompt_feedback=None usage_metadata=GenerateContentResponseUsageMetadata(cached_content_token_count=None, candidates_token_count=588, prompt_token_count=7, total_token_count=595) automatic_function_calling_history=[] parsed=None\n",
